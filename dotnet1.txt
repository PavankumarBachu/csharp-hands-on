What is .NET?


a) .NET is a framework
Framework is a software infrastructure, used to develop applications, debug or test or build the project


b) .NET is used to develop any kind of Applications, Services and Class libraries
Applications like
	Console Application
	Windows Forms Application
	Web Application
	Mobile Application

Services
	Windows Services
	SOAP services
	RESTful Services

c) .NET support all patterns
Example:	nTier architecture, MVC Pattern, MVVM patterns, RESTful, etc.,

.NET Framework is only for windows ( Not avaliable in other platforms)
.NET Core is platform independent (Available for windows, Linux and Mac)

.NET support multiple programming languages for development
Like:	C#, VB, VC++, etc.,

.NET support advanced programming features, for faster application development


C# (C-Sharp)
It is a programming language from Microsoft
C# is an OOPs programming language
C# is commonly used in .NET Technoloiges and also in other frameworks

Visual Studio
It is an IDE from Microsoft, specially designed to develop or test or run or debug .NET Applications
Visual studio available for other technoloiges like .NET, Node, python, etc.,


Console Application:
	It is an application, used to create command line program which can interact with requirement directly.
Without UI or mouse we can interact with system.

What is a project?
	A project is a complete application
	Project contains file extension .csproj, .vbproj

What is Solution?
	Solution is a collection of projects
	Solution contians an extension .sln

.NET Framework recognize the project and files and solutions based on thier extensions



Console Application structure:

using System;				//import library

namespace ConApp01			//Project boundary
{
	class Program			//Class definition
	{
		public static void Main()	//Main method, project entry
		{
		}
	}
}

Keywords:
using	:	Used to import library
namespace:	Used to create a boundary
class	:	Refers to class definition

using System;
	System is a root namespace for .NET Technoloiges API


Visual Studio features:
code snippets
	The syntax can be generated without writing
	write first 2 or 3 letters and click on tab+tab
Example:
	svm	tab+tab
	cw 	tab+tab
	if 	tab+tab
	swich 	tab+tab
	prop	tab+tab
	ctro	tab+tab

Reference highlighting
	This feature is used to provide reference for the keyword by mousehover

//Comments are non-executable statements
//single line comments
/*
	multi line comments

CTS:	Common Type System
It is a hierarchy of all data types used in .NET Technoligies
Value types
	int
	char
	double
	bool, etc.,
Reference types
	String,
	Delegate,
	Pointer, etc.,


integer data type available in different sizes
Example:
	Data type			alias
	-----------			-----
	System.Int16			short
	System.Int32			int		
	System.Int64			long

Note:	All types under System namespace


Convert class method
Convert.ToInt16()	:	to convert type to Int16
Convert.ToInt32()	:	to convert type to Int32

Convert.ToChar()	:	to convert char type, etc., 


Int.Parse() is method in Int32 type

Convert is a dedicated class contains all methods together
Example:	
Convert.ToInt32() is an alias definition of Int.Parse()
